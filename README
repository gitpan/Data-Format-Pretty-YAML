DESCRIPTION
    This module uses YAML::Syck to encode data as YAML.

FUNCTIONS
  format_pretty($data, \%opts)
    Return formatted data structure as YAML. Currently there are no known
    options. YAML::Syck's settings are optimized for prettiness, currently
    as follows:

     $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping = 1;
     $YAML::Syck::SortKeys       = 1;
     $YAML::Syck::Headless       = 1;

    Options:

    *   color => BOOL

        Whether to enable coloring. The default is the enable only when
        running interactively. Currently also enable line numbering.

  content_type() => STR
    Return "text/yaml".

ENVIRONMENT
  COLOR => BOOL
    Set "color" option (if unset).
