NAME
    Data::Format::Pretty::YAML - Pretty-print data structure as YAML

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.08 of Data::Format::Pretty::YAML (from
    Perl distribution Data-Format-Pretty-YAML), released on 2014-12-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Format::Pretty::YAML qw(format_pretty);
     print format_pretty($data);

    Some example output:

    *   format_pretty({a=>1, b=>2})

          a: 1
          b: 2

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses YAML::Syck to encode data as YAML.

FUNCTIONS
  format_pretty($data, \%opts)
    Return formatted data structure as YAML. Currently there are no known
    options. YAML::Syck's settings are optimized for prettiness, currently
    as follows:

     $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping = 1;
     $YAML::Syck::SortKeys       = 1;
     $YAML::Syck::Headless       = 1;

    Options:

    *   color => BOOL (default: from env or 1)

        Whether to enable coloring. The default is the enable only when
        running interactively.

    *   pretty => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to focus on prettyness. If set to 0, will focus on producing
        valid YAML instead of prettiness.

    *   linum => BOOL (default: from env or 0)

        Whether to enable line numbering.

  content_type() => STR
    Return "text/yaml".

ENVIRONMENT
  COLOR => BOOL
    Set "color" option (if unset).

  LINUM => BOOL
    Set "linum" option (if unset).
